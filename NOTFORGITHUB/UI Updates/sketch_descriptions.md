# Visual Sketch Descriptions

## Sketch 1: Current UI Problems
This sketch annotates the existing interface with six major problems:
1. Too many buttons competing for attention (Check Credits and Show Song History)
2. Yellow boxes create visual noise around collapsible sections
3. Decorative icons (guitar, drum, headphones, etc.) serve no purpose
4. Red warning box creates anxiety
5. Small textarea doesn't encourage detailed descriptions
6. Primary CTA (Generate Song button) gets lost among competing elements

## Sketch 2: Improved Visual Hierarchy
This sketch demonstrates the recommended improvements:
- Secondary actions (Credits, History) moved to subtle top navigation
- Large, prominent textarea as the focal point (approximately 40% of card height)
- Single prominent green "Generate Song" button with play icon
- Neutral informational banner at bottom instead of red warning
- Collapsible "How it works" section (collapsed by default)
- Character counter clearly visible (0/500)
- "View Example Prompts" link below textarea
- Significantly more whitespace and breathing room throughout

## Sketch 3: Before & After Comparison
Side-by-side comparison showing:
- BEFORE: Cluttered interface with multiple competing buttons, yellow highlighted boxes, decorative icons, red warning, and cramped spacing
- AFTER: Clean interface with large textarea, single prominent CTA, subtle top navigation, increased whitespace, and neutral info banner
- Clear visual contrast with red X marks on "Before" and green checkmarks on "After"

## Sketch 4: Mobile Responsive Design
Comparison of mobile experiences:
- CURRENT PROBLEMS: Touch targets too small, text unreadable, horizontal scrolling required, cramped layout
- IMPROVED MOBILE-FIRST: Large touch targets (44x44px minimum), readable text (16px+), no horizontal scroll, hamburger menu for secondary functions, thumb-friendly layout with large textarea and prominent button

## Sketch 5: Component-Level Improvements
Four detailed before/after comparisons:
1. Textarea: Small box → Large expanded textarea with helpful placeholder and visible character counter
2. Button Hierarchy: Three competing buttons → One large primary button with secondary actions in top nav
3. Warning Message: Alarming red box → Subtle neutral info banner with icon
4. Tips Section: Yellow highlighted expanded section → Clean collapsed section with simple arrow

## Sketch 6: Improved User Flow
Flowchart showing streamlined user journey:
- START: User lands on page
- STEP 1: Large textarea immediately draws attention
- DECISION: Need help? → YES: View examples modal → Return to textarea; NO: Type directly
- STEP 2: Click prominent "Generate Song" button
- STEP 3: Progress indicator with estimated time
- STEP 4: Song ready notification
- STEP 5: Play, download, or view in history
- Secondary flows (Credits, History) accessible from top nav without interrupting main flow
- Annotations highlight: Linear flow, minimal decisions, clear feedback, no distractions
